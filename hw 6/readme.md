# Homework 6: PHP & MySql

This assignment focuses on making use of `PHP` & `MySQL` to access, read and write sales data.
It like Homeowrk 5 consists of two parts, an initial set up and then implementation

## Part A: Setup

Using either `MySQL Workbench` or a CLI run the `RestaurantSales-DatabaseBuild.sql` and show the running data
Deadline: Dec 5

## Part B: Implementation

> Remove all local storage implementation, no more client side data store

Using the script in the previous section manipulate a `ResturantSales-DatabaseInterface.php` script to handle transmission to the database context and it's two tables. 

Use 6 AJAX requests to send data from the `cashier.html` page to handle reading & writing all sale data
