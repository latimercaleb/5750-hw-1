               <img src='styles/img/nintendoRuralIntro.jpg' />
               <p class='pure-u-5-5'>What gamer doesn't know Nintendo? If your a 90's kid lke me then Nintendo is probably what first brought you into the world of being a gamer. So of course I'm gonna recommend you go see the newly founded in 2006 musuem funded by Nintendo near the Kyoto Prefecture. The museum isn't focused around the video game makers though, it's main feature is "Hyakunin Isshu" a poetry based card game with 100 poems. Giant tiles are spread across the floor and players aim to match poem cards before their opponent. It pays homage to history and has a super modern look and feel as the panes are full interactive and can even be manipulated remotely with customized Nintendo DS handhelds. There is also a rock garden, tons of experimental interactive game tech,and other games making it well worth the trip.</p>

        <div class='pure-g'>
            <h2 class='pure-u-5-5'>Don't just sight see, get in the game</h2>
            <p class='pure-u-5-5'>If you're in Akihabara there's a ton to do so grab your coffee, your snacks and get ready for a long haul. Because from binging anime to internet cafes we are gonna break down the hotspots so you that you know where to be. Major stuff to do breaks down into the following 3 categories:</p>
            <ul class='pure-u-5-5'>
              <li>Video Game Stuff</li>
              <li>Computer Stuff</li>
              <li>Otaku Stuff</li>
            </ul>
            <p class='pure-u-5-5'>Now before you start, yes <i>technically</i> all of the above are <b>Otaku</b> types of hobbies but no two snowflakes are the same. These 3 main groups of hobbies have the biggest range of shops and centers catering to that group. So looking at this objectively limiting our scope in a simple manner helps solve the TSP(traveling salesman problem) or in this case. The TOP(traveling otaku problem)</p>
