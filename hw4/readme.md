# Homework 4: JavaScript and JSON

This assignment focuses on making use of JavaScript, HTML storage and working with data in JSON format. I used the following technologies:

- Bootstrap 3
- jQuery

**Notes**
- `Entree`, `Drink`, `Tip` should all be integers in the multiple sales array
- `SalesID` should be a unique key starting at 1000, so first visible value must be `1001`
- Next and prev buttons should function modularly, so it should start the list over once you reach either end
- Reset sale should only clear form fields
- Delete deletes current sale
- Reset all deletes entire object storage
- All sales are edittable post-save
- No need for other html aside from `Cashier.html`, can use previous code as template to get started
