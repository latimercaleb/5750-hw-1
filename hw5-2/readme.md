# Homework 5-2: PHP & AJAX

This assignment focuses on making use of PHP and AJAX techniques to access a data-store in an AMPPS instance to get data to and from a running web app:

- Bootstrap 3
- Materialize CSS (*components only*)
- jQuery
- jQuery UI (*maybe???*) <- I really wanna

**Notes**
- Extension of HW4, reuse former code as a baseline
- Use two external files for the data entry and read from using AJAX
	* File names and formats can be custom (recommended *AJAX* or *JSON*)
- Client Side logic is preferred
- Summary page must be a new page with `php` and run on server to render
- Make use of global vars and query strings to produce results in php layer, possible to use other methods here, do some research
